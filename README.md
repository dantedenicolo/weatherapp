This is a basic WeatherApp created with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## Live Deploy

You can try the app in [https://weatherapp.dantu.me/](https://weatherapp.dantu.me/).

## Roadmap

- Start project with Svelte
- UI/UX design
- IP API integration (used for getting user's location)
- Weather API integration
- Initial deploy
- Eslint up-to-date

## How to start?

If you want to work with this project, you need to follow these steps:

First you need to clone the repo using the following command:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/dantedenicolo/weatherapp.git
```

Then, you need to make sure you are working in the correct project folder. You can access directly the route by using the following command in the same console in which you cloned the repo:

```bash
  cd weatherapp
```

Now you need to install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
  npm install
```

Finally, you need to run the server. You can to this by using the following command (this will start the development server):

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Once you have done that, you can now review, inspect, and edit the code as you want. Feel free to do wathever you want and to give feedback if needed. Please note that this is my first project in react, so many things need to be improved.
